Welcome to the Ctrl-F project! Ctrl-F is an open source software which is designed to assist users to select text from PDFs...right from your browser. 

The problem: https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTdc7ecq6/?k=1 

The solution: PDFs are documents that are generally pretty good at allowing you to select the text in your document... until it doesn't. Using computer vision and OCR software is a good step to doing just that again! 

Once that solution is developed, we'll allow users to interface with this software by downloading a simple browser extension, providing very useful functionality with very little overhead. 

The goal: Give users access to OCR software that isn't just efficient, but is also fast and convenient to use.
